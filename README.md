# A_B-Testing Project overview:
From a supplied dataset, work with provided hypotheses from a marketing department using the concepts of Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort to determine
which hypothese will be most likely to boost an online store's projected revenue. 

### Steps that will be taken in the analysis:
●	Utilized Python to aggregate, clean, extract, visualize and explore the company’s data<br>
●	Prioritize hypothese using two separate framework models and how priotization changes between the two.<br>
●	Apply A/B testing to the models and determine the best hypothese

The analsys will incorporate cummalitive averages, exploring outliers and looking at conversion rates. 
Hypothese that will be tested are:<br><li>
Add two new channels for attracting traffic. This will bring 30% more users<li>
Launch your own delivery service. This will shorten delivery time<li>
Add product recommendation blocks to the store's site. This will increase conversion and average purchase size<li>
Change the category structure. This will increase conversion since users will find the products they want more quickly<li>
Change the background color on the main page. This will increase user engagement<li>
Add a customer review page. This will increase the number of orders<li>
Show banners with current offers and sales on the main page. This will boost conversion<li>
Add a subscription form to all the main pages. This will help you compile a mailing list<li>
Launch a promotion that gives users discounts on their birthdays

We'll use frameworks to as a comparison for the hypotheses to determine the best ones. This framework involves:<br><li>
Reach — how many users will be affected by the update you want to
introduce<li>
Impact — how strongly this update will affect the users, their experience, and
their satisfaction with the product<li>
Confidence — how sure you are that your product will affect them in this way<li>
Effort — how much will it cost to test the hypothesis

This will rate our hypotheses on a scale of 1-10. Below is what our comparison looks like using the applied framework.
