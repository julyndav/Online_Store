●	Utilized Python to aggregate, clean, extract, visualize and explore the company’s data<p> 
●	Split the source data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set<p>
●	Investigate the quality of different models by changing hyperparameters to produce a final model with an accuracy of 75%<p>
●	Check the quality of the model using the test set and run sanity check
